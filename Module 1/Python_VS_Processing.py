In Processing, we use semi colons and brackets. 

In Python we don't. Instead we use indents and colons!

For example...

# Variables | Module 2
integer = 1
float = 20.0
boolean = True
string = "Wow!"

# Function
print("Hello world!")


# If Statement | Module 
my_variable = 123
if my_variable > 100:
    # Conditonal Statments | Module 
    if my_variable > 100 and my_variable < 110: # Instead of && and || we explicitly just say the word. (&& -> and) (|| -> or)
        print("Variable is greater than 100 but less than 110")
    elif my_variable >= 110 or my_variable == 123:
        print("Variable is greater than or equal to 110! or it equals 123! ðŸ˜®")
    else:
        print("Variable is greater than 100!")

# Switch Case (New in Python 3.10, but not in programming.) It's like a If statement. | Better explained in Module 3
match my_variable:
    case 123:
        print("The variable's value is 123.")

    case 100:
        print("The variables value is 100.")

    case _:
            print("The variables value wasn't one that was listed.")


# For Loop
my_list = [123, 20, True, "What? Multiple Types???"]
for x in my_list:
    print(type(x)) # Outputs the type each item in the list is. (eg. 123 -> int)


# While Loop
my_counter = 0
while my_counter < 10:
    my_counter += 1 # add one to counter
    print("Hello, " + str(x) + " times!") # We have to convert the variable x into a string or we will get an error!


# Class
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, _myValue):
        self.myValue = _myValue

    def MyClass_Function(self):

In the coming modules, we will go over each example in this file.

Do not fret!
