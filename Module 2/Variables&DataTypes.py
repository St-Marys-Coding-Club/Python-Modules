'''
Data Types you can find in python are:

    - Integers
    - Floats
    - Booleans
    - Strings
    - Lists
    - Dictionaries
    - Classes and Objects

These are just the types we will be exploring. There are alot of types in python like bytes (b'') but 
we won't cover them because they too complicated for now. If you are curious, you can visit
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
for a full documentation page on all the standard types and their functionality in Python.

Integer = 10 # A whole number

Float = 21.4 # A decimal number

Boolean = True # A True or False | 1 or 0

String = "Hello world!" # A line of text 

List = [1, True, "Wow!", 2.44] # A list of data

Dictionary = {
        "name": "St. Mary's",
        "occupation": "Coding", # A way to store data in a key:value system.
        "organization": "Club" 
       }

       

'''Classes / Objects will be explained in a later module.'''
