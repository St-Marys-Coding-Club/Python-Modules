    - Classes and Objects

These are just the types we will be exploring. There are alot of types in python like bytes (b'') but 
we won't cover them because they too complicated for now. If you are curious, you can visit
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
for a full documentation page on all the standard types and their functionality in Python.
